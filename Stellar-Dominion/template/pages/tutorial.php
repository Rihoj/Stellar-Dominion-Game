                        <p class="text-lg mb-4">Welcome, Commander. Your journey begins now. The universe of Stellar Dominion is persistent, meaning your empire grows even when you're offline. Here‚Äôs how to build a strong foundation:</p>
                        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 text-lg">
                            <li><strong>The Turn System is Everything:</strong> Every **10 minutes**, a "turn" passes. With each turn, you automatically gain resources like **Attack Turns**, **Untrained Citizens**, and **Credits**. Your goal is to maximize the income from every single turn.</li>
                            <li><strong>Your First Priority - Workers:</strong> Your initial goal should be to build a powerful economy. Navigate to the **Training** page (under the BATTLE menu) and train your starting 'Untrained Citizens' into **'Workers'**. Each Worker generates credits for you every turn, accelerating your growth exponentially.</li>
                             <li><strong>Stay Active for Experience:</strong> In Stellar Dominion, activity is rewarded. You gain small amounts of **Experience Points (XP)** for almost every action: training units, building structures, and buying armory items. This XP is crucial for leveling up, so continuous engagement is key.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2 class="font-title text-3xl text-yellow-400 mb-4">üí∞ Phase 2: Mastering the Galactic Economy</h2>
                        <p class="text-lg mb-4">A powerful military is useless without a massive economy to support it. The economy has been rebalanced; costs are high, but so are the potential rewards.</p>
                        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 text-lg">
                            <li><strong>Workers Remain Key:</strong> This cannot be overstated. The more workers you have, the more credits you earn. A steady stream of income is vital for affording the new high-cost structures and items.</li>
                            <li><strong>The Bank is Your Lifeline:</strong> Credits in your hand can be stolen by other players. Use the **Bank** (under the HOME menu) to deposit your credits frequently and keep them safe. A wealthy commander with no banked credits is a prime target.</li>
                            <li><strong>Leveling for Wealth:</strong> As you battle and level up, you'll earn Proficiency Points. Investing these in the **Wealth** stat on the **Levels** page provides a permanent percentage bonus to your income. This is one of the most powerful long-term investments you can make.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p class="text-lg mb-4">Once your economy is generating a significant surplus, it's time to build your fleet. A strong military allows you to attack other players for profit and defend your own resources.</p>
                        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 text-lg">
                            <li><strong>Soldiers vs. Guards:</strong> **Soldiers** increase your 'Offense Power' for attacking. **Guards** increase your 'Defense Rating' to protect you. A good balance is crucial. Early on, a 1:1 ratio is a safe bet.</li>
                            <li><strong>The Armory is MANDATORY:</strong> You cannot succeed without gear. First, you must build and upgrade your **Armory** on the **Structures** page. Each Armory level unlocks a new tier of powerful weapons and armor. Then, visit the **Armory** page (under BATTLE) to purchase this equipment for your soldiers and guards. An unequipped army is a dead army.</li>
                            <li><strong>Scouting & Attacking:</strong> On the **Attack** page, you can see a list of other commanders. **Scout** a profile before attacking to see their army size and stats. Attacking a player with a large amount of un-banked credits can be very profitable, but ensure your Offense Power is higher than their Defense Rating.</li>

                        <h2 class="font-title text-3xl text-yellow-400 mb-4">ü§ù Phase 4: Advanced Strategy - The Power of Alliances</h2>
                        <p class="text-lg mb-4">While a lone commander can be formidable, true galactic power lies in numbers. Alliances are player-formed groups that offer game-changing advantages.</p>
                        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 text-lg">
                            <li><strong>Join or Create:</strong> You can apply to an existing alliance or create your own. As a leader, you can set roles and permissions for your members.</li>
                            <li>**The Alliance Bank & Structures:** Members can donate credits to a shared bank. This bank is used to purchase powerful **Alliance Structures** that provide passive bonuses‚Äîlike increased income or combat stats‚Äîto **every single member** of the alliance. This is the fastest way to accelerate your entire group's power.</li>
                            <li>**Coordination is Victory:** Use the private alliance **Forum** to coordinate attacks with your allies, share strategies, and help each other grow. A well-organized alliance can dominate the leaderboards and protect its members from outside threats.</li>

                                <h3 class="font-semibold text-white text-lg">What is the fastest way to get credits?</h3>
                                <p>In the early game, the fastest and safest way is to train **Workers**. In the mid-to-late game, attacking other players for a percentage of their un-banked credits becomes the most profitable method, but it's also the riskiest.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div>
                                <h3 class="font-semibold text-white text-lg">Why can't I build a structure? It says "Unavailable".</h3>
                                <p>This is usually due to one of three reasons: 1) You don't have enough **credits**, 2) You don't meet the minimum **player level requirement**, or 3) You haven't built the required prerequisite structure (e.g., you need a Level 2 Foundation to build a Level 1 Armory).</p>
                            </div>
                             <div>
                                <h3 class="font-semibold text-white text-lg">I have enough XP but I'm not leveling up. Why?</h3>
                                <p>The game automatically processes level-ups when you visit the **Levels** page. Simply navigate to Home -> Levels, and the system will grant you any pending levels and proficiency points you've earned.</p>
                            </div>

                                <h3 class="font-semibold text-white text-lg">What should I spend my Proficiency Points on first?</h3>
                                <p>A balanced approach is best, but a strong early strategy is to put points into **Wealth** to boost your economy and **Charisma** to make training your initial army of workers and soldiers cheaper.</p>
