# Migration from Custom to AWS Managed Rotation

## Summary of Changes

You were absolutely right to point out that AWS Secrets Manager has built-in rotation for Aurora/RDS! I've updated the implementation to use AWS managed rotation instead of a custom Lambda function.

## What Changed

### ❌ **Before: Custom Rotation Implementation**
```yaml
DatabaseRotationLambda:
    Type: AWS::Lambda::Function  # Custom Lambda function
    Properties:
        Runtime: python3.9
        Code:
            ZipFile: |
                # 200+ lines of custom Python code
                # That we had to write, maintain, and debug
```

### ✅ **After: AWS Managed Rotation**
```yaml
DatabaseCredentialsSecretRotationSchedule:
    Type: AWS::SecretsManager::RotationSchedule
    Properties:
        HostedRotationLambda:
            RotationType: MySQLSingleUser  # AWS-managed template
            VpcSecurityGroupIds: ${self:custom.vpcConfig.securityGroupIds}
            VpcSubnetIds: ${self:custom.vpcConfig.subnetIds}
            ExcludeCharacters: "\"@/\\"
```

## Benefits of AWS Managed Rotation

1. **✅ Battle-Tested**: Used by thousands of AWS customers
2. **✅ AWS Maintained**: Security patches and updates handled automatically
3. **✅ Better Error Handling**: Comprehensive retry logic and rollback
4. **✅ AWS Support**: Official support for troubleshooting
5. **✅ Less Code**: No custom Lambda function to maintain
6. **✅ Optimized**: Performance improvements from AWS testing
7. **✅ Secure**: Follows AWS security best practices

## Removed Resources

The following resources are no longer needed:
- `DatabaseRotationLambda` (custom Lambda function)
- `DatabaseRotationLambdaRole` (custom IAM role)
- `DatabaseRotationLambdaPermission` (custom Lambda permission)

## What Stays the Same

- ✅ Secret structure and credentials format
- ✅ 30-day rotation schedule
- ✅ VPC configuration for Aurora access
- ✅ Application code and SecretsManagerService
- ✅ All documentation about rotation behavior

## Deployment

The new managed rotation will be created automatically when you deploy:

```bash
sls deploy --stage prod
```

AWS will create and configure the managed rotation Lambda function for you, using the proven `MySQLSingleUser` template specifically designed for Aurora MySQL databases.

## Cost Impact

**Managed rotation is often cheaper** than custom implementations because:
- AWS optimizes the Lambda function for performance
- Fewer failed attempts due to better error handling
- No maintenance overhead for custom code

Thank you for pointing this out! Using AWS managed services is always the better choice when available.
